## Project Overview:
Note Me is a web-based note-taking application written using React.js and Nest.js, and Prisma, with a PostgreSQL database as the backend. It provides users with a convenient platform for creating, editing, and managing their notes. The application offers a range of features, including note creation, editing, deletion, and organization. Users can mark certain notes as favorites and easily access them on a dedicated favorites page. Additionally, deleted notes are stored separately with an option to restore them if needed.
In addition to the note-taking functionality, Note Me includes a whiteboard page. The whiteboard page adds a dynamic and interactive element to the application, providing users with a versatile tool for visual expression and brainstorming.

## Client Side Technology Stack:
The client-side of Note Me is built using React.js with TypeScript, offering a robust and scalable front-end framework. The project utilizes various libraries, including React Query for efficient data management and caching, React Flow for building interactive whiteboard, Ant Design (Antd) for UI components, and React Router DOM for handling routing within the application.

## Server Side Technology Stack:
The server-side of Note Me is implemented using Nest.js, a progressive TypeScript framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications. Nest.js allows for seamless creation of endpoints and facilitates seamless integration with the PostgreSQL database for efficient data retrieval and storage. In addition, Note Me utilizes Prisma as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database management.

## Authentication:
To ensure a secure and personalized experience, Note Me incorporates user identification and authentication. User information is stored in a PostgreSQL database, and the application verifies the user's credentials during the login process. Upon successful login, users receive a token that grants them access to the site's functionalities.

## Deployment:
The Note Me website is deployed and hosted on a server accessible via the URL: https://note-me.onrender.com/. The deployment ensures that users can access the application reliably and securely from anywhere with an internet connection. Please note that the mentioned URL for the deployed website may not be accessible at the time of reading as it is subject to availability and maintenance.
